   <p class ="instructions">Feelings of anxiety and depression can often be caused by negative thoughts. Being able to change those thoguhts is one of the most
        powerful tools one can have to fight those feelings. We have trouble with these thoughts because they feel true and we feel powerless against
        the precieved consequences of that truth. But while there is often a kernal of truth in these thoughts, that is not the same as the thought
        being true. Do not underestimate the power of our words and thoughts. Small changes can make a big difference in our emotional and mental well-being. </p>
